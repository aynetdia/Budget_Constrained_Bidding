    "Allocating budget efficiently is a problem that has received a lot of attention in marketing literature. Budget constrained bidding, as an automated bidding strategy and a common scenario in Real-Time Bidding (RTB), is an important concept in online display advertising.

The tutorial is based on the findings of Wu D., et al. (2018) presented in \"Budget Constrained Bidding by Model-free Reinforcement Learning in Display Advertising\".

    "Real-time bidding is a trading mechanism for online display advertising. It is an auction and describes the mechanism of advertisers setting a bid price for every ad impression (i.e. the ad placement) in real-time (Liu et al., 2019).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 illustrates the following process of RTB. An ad impression is created when a user visits an ad-supported site (e.g. webpage or mobile apps) which then triggers an auction. Then an ad request is sent by the supply-side platform (SSP, such as a webpage) to the ad exchange (ADX, which publishes the bid requests to the DSPs and that also holds auctions to determine which campaign win the ad impression). Accordingly, the demand-side platform (DSP, i.e. the advertisers’ buying systems) generates different bid prices. A bid price is based on users’ features (e.g. region) and ad features (e.g. ad dimension) extracted from the data management platform (DMP) or the webpage itself. The ADX then determines the winning advertiser (Liu et al., 2019). Solely the highest bidder wins the ad impression opportunity to display its ad on the webpage.   \n",
    "\n",
    "According to the widely used second-price auction principal, the winning advertiser pays the second highest bid in the auction (Wu et al., 2018). This cost basically is defined as the market price (Zhang et al., 2014). The second-price auction ensures that the bid price for each ad impression should be equal to its true value of an action (e.g. click-through-rate). \n",

    "## 1.2 Budget Constrained Bidding\n",
    "\n",
    "Budget Constrained Bidding is an automated bidding strategy in RTB. It serves as a mechanism to address the typical optimization goal, where advertisers opt to maximize the total value of winning impressions under a certain budget constraint. Generally, an impression is the presence of an online advertisement on e.g. a browsing website. A winning impression value is associated with the expected outcome of an advertisement, e.g. a click on the ad or conversion as user feedback.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A bidding strategy is based on the evaluation of impressions on an ad campaign, e.g. by the predicted click-through rate (CTR) or calculated bid price for each impression.   \n",
    "A campaign runs during a certain time period that captures $N$ impression opportunities in sequential order $i$. Considering the competition with other bidders in real-time and the impression value $v{_i}$ of an ad placement, an advertiser gives a bid $b{_i}$ and only wins the auction if $b{_i}$ is the highest bid (Wu D., et al., 2018). In this case, the advertiser gets the opportunity to display the ad and thus, wins the ad impression, which then induces costs $c{_i}$. An optimal bid in RTB with budget constraint B takes the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ b{_i} = v{_i} / \\lambda, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $v{_i}$ denotes the impression value of an ad placement and $\\lambda$ a scaling parameter mapping $v{_i}$ to the scale of the bid (Zhang W., et al., 2016). If $\\lambda$ increases, then the bid price decreases. Hence, a high constrained budget should cause the general bidding price level to be lower (Zhang W., et al., 2014).  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the optimal bidding strategy depends on the market competition, auction volume and campaign budget. Bidding strategies usually consider the bid decision by treating each ad impression independently, ignoring the impacts of the overall effectiveness of the campaign and the dynamics of the RTB environment. Since the market price (the second highest bid price) is unknown during the budget constrained bidding in a real-time bidding environment, developing an optimal bidding strategy is complex to derive but yet crucial for advertisers to maximize their budget cost efficiency of each ad campaign. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a solution to the above problem.\n",

    "The basic idea of the Knapsack problem is to find an optimal strategy under some constraints. For example, how to choose the most suitable items to be placed in the backpack in order to maximize the values of the items, given limited total weight. Such problems can usually be solved recursively, i.e., by converting the original problem into an iterable subproblem and then solving it optimally by dynamic programming methods. KP is decomposed into multiple P, each instance P’ in RL represents a P and will be described as [ state, action, reward ] (Reza R.A, Yingqian Z., Murat F. et al， 2020). Regarding our research subject, budget constrained bidding is basically a knapsack problem (Zhou Y., et al., 2008). In this paper, we will apply Reinforcement Learning to efficiently allocate a given budget and try to gain maximum rewards.\n",

    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a tool to support sequential decision-making events and is a highly active research field of machine learning. It finds enormous application in e.g. real-time-bidding in advertisement auction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make the process more clear, we first explain some basic concept of RL as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Policy: the whole actions the learning agent has taken in a concrete period \n",
    "\n",
    "- Agent: the one who takes the action\n",
    "\n",
    "- Environment: the place where the agent takes action and interacts with him\n",
    "\n",
    "- Action: the move the agent makes to interact with the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- State: a situation in which the agent perceives \n",
    "\n",
    "- Reward: feedback of the agent’s action \t\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "RL is a solution for core control problems in which an agent sequentially interacts with an unknown environment to maximize its cumulative reward (Richard S. and Andrew G., 2018). It is a simulation of the human learning process in dynamic environments without any supervision. To find the best strategy of reward maximization, the agent continuously interacts with the environment and finds the optimal action under different states. Roughly speaking, the agent’s goal is to get as much reward as possible over the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, board game playing is a classical dynamic decision-making process. Players need to interact with their counterparts. It is a procedure filled with immediate rewards, intuitive judgments, and each action will generate an impact in the end. The cumulative reward will decide its win-or-failure (Richard S. and Andrew G., 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, such scenarios will consist of several problems that can be solved by a class of solution methods, but not all of them can achieve the rewards maximization objective. In the learning process of RL, each action the agent made, will generate some impact not only on the immediate reward but also on the future states. In other words, RL faces a dynamic decision-making problem, the agent will obtain continuous rewards and punishments in this learning process and modify its behaviors according to the environment's feedbacks and finally to maximize the cumulative reward.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a popular mechanisms to model Reinforcement Learning problems. MDP (Sutton and Barto, 2014) provides a framework that is widely used for modeling the dynamic agent-environment interactions - as mentioned and depicted in figure 4.   \n",
    "\n",
    "An MDP can be represented by a tuple (S, A, P, R), where S and A denotes sets of all states and all possible actions $a$ $\\in$ $A$  in state $s$ $\\in$ $S$, P represents the state transition probability from state $s$ $\\in$ $S$ to another state $s^\\prime$ $\\in$ $S$ when taking action $a$ $\\in$ $A$ that is denoted as $\\mathrm{𝑇}(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠^\\prime)$ and R represents the reward function that is denoted as $r(a,s,s^\\prime)$. Accordingly, in MDP the interaction process between the agent and its environment is summarized as the following: The agent observes state $s_t$ from the environment and takes action $a_t$ according to the policy strategy $\\pi$ in each time step t∈T (Liu et al., 2019). In MDP the state transition $𝑇(𝑠,𝑎,𝑠^\\prime)$ produces the probability $𝑃(𝑠^\\prime | 𝑠,𝑎)$ to transition from state s into state $𝑠^\\prime$, given that the agent took action 𝑎. The environment then returns a reward $r_t$ to the agent. The rewards (numerical values) can be positive or negative based on the agents’ actions (Sutton and Barto, 2014,  Liu et al., 2019). \n",
    "The agent then observes the next state and the process repeats. MDP will terminate after T time steps (e.g. after the budget is exhausted) since the time is limited.    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In MDP the policy $\\pi$ is a mechanism to take decisions. Policies are defined by the action an agent takes on the current state (it does not depend on history) (Sutton and Barto, 2014). The agent uses the policy to interact with the environment by sequentially taking actions and to alter its behavior in order to maximize the cumulative reward 𝑅 (all the rewards that the agent receives from the environment) (Wu D., et al., 2018).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the goal of the agent is to learn the optimal policy $\\pi^*$ , which maximizes the long-term expected reward form the start state:\n",
    "$$\\pi^* = arg max_{\\pi}  E [R | \\pi],$$ where $R = \\sum^T_{t=1} \\gamma^{t-1} r_t $ denotes the cumulative discounted reward (Wu D., et al., 2018).    \n",

    "## 2.4 Bellman Equation for value functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning mostly involves estimating **value functions**, which are functions of states (quantifies the value of every state-action pair) (Sutton and Barto, 2014). It is used to estimate how good it is for the agent to be in a given state, i.e. how good (or bad) future rewards are that can be expected from experience (expected return). Since the expected return depends on the action that the agent will take, the value functions are defined respectively to particular policies. \n",
    "As mentioned earlier in section 2.2, MDPs aims to help the agent to find an optimal policy in its environment. Policies are defined by the action an agent takes on the current state. The objective of MDP policies is to maximize the expected return (reward from the environment) for the agent. Thus, the policy $\\pi$ of the value function defines the probability distribution of taking action when in state s (Sutton and Barto, 2014), which essentially determines the behavior of an agent. For instance, this corresponds to the bidding strategy in RTB display advertising. If an agent follows a policy $\\pi$ at time 𝑡 then $\\pi(𝑎|𝑠)$ is the probability of that agent taking action 𝑎 at a particular time step 𝑡. The policy $\\pi$ is defined as follows (Singh A., 2019):    \n",
    "$$\\pi: S \\rightarrow P(A) .$$ \n",
    "So essentially, it is used to estimate how good an agent's actions $a$ $\\in$ $A$ in a particular state $s$ $\\in$ $S$ is.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Bellman Equation for value function** $v_\\pi$ expresses the relationship between the value of a state $s$ and the values of its successor state $s^\\prime$ (Sutton and Barto, 2014). It helps to determine optimal policies and optimal value functions. \n",
    "The agent chooses the action according to the imposed policy. We know that policy changes with experience. Hence, different policies imply different value functions. \n",
    "The optimal value function is the one that gives the maximum value. So, we choose a sequence of actions that will generate the highest reward which is the cumulative reward (referred to as Quality Value (Q-Value) in section 2.5). We will receive the highest Q-Value from $s^\\prime$  by choosing the action that maximizes the Q-Value.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the Bellman Equation is the expectation of reward the agent got on leaving the state $s$ plus the discounted value of the state $s^\\prime$  the agent moved to. The Bellman Equation can be decomposed into the immediate reward, $R[t+1]$ , and the discounted value of successor states:\n",

    "## 2.5 Deep Q-Networks  \n",
    "As mentioned in section 2.4, we will use a model-free RL algorithm to deal with the shortcomings of CMDP. Deep Q-Network (DQN) (Mnih, Kavukcuoglu, Silver, et al., 2015) combines the methods of reinforcement learning and deep neural networks to map the environment states to the agents’ actions. DQN is a popular method of Q-learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Q-learning** algorithms (Watkins & Dayan, 1992) can be used when the probabilities of transitions are unknown, and when the state or action spaces are large. It focuses on learning a Q-Function that qualifies a state-action pair. So, the Q-Function tells us the value of performing a certain action or respectively how good it is for the agent to take action (a) in a state (s) with a policy $\\pi$.\n",
    "It iteratively computes the optimal value function, i.e. for each state s at each timestep t , the optimal value Q*(s,a,t) of each action a is estimated (Sutton and Barto, 2014).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A Q-Value (Quality Value) represents the expected long-term reward of a Q-Learning algorithm under the assumption that the agent takes a perfect sequence of actions from a specific state. At any given state, we perform the action that will eventually yield the highest cumulative reward. This makes the algorithm greedy (Mnih, Kavukcuoglu, Silver, et al., 2015). \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, Q-Learning utilizes the Bellman Equation. To estimate these state/action values, we can then update it using the Bellman Equation as an update rule (Watkins & Dayan, 1992):  \n",
    "$$ Q(s,a) := r(s,a) + \\gamma max_a Q(s^\\prime, a)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in section 2.3, it roughly states that the maximum future reward for a specific action is the current immediate reward plus the future reward for taking action.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the main challenge of Q-Learning and Bellman Equation is to the compute cost associated with estimating all combinations of state-action rewards, involving a large number of states. Thus, we approximate a Q-function instead of learning an exact Q-Function that evaluates all possible Q-Values. This is where DQN comes into play. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQN** (Mnih, Kavukcuoglu, Silver, et al., 2015) uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-Function corresponding to the optimal policy without the need of handcrafting useful features, as shown in figure 4. Recall that the goal of an agent is to select actions in order to maximize the cumulative reward. This cumulative reward that we receive is often referred to as the Q-Value. Thus, by utilizing deep neural networks we can approximate the Q-Value of all possible actions for given states.  This is referred to as the approximate value function $Q(s,a;\\theta_i)$, where $\\theta_i$ is the parameter (i.e. weights) of the Q-network at iteration i. To ensure that experience replay can be performed, the agents experiences $e_t=(s_t,a_t,r_t,s_{t+1})$ at each time step t in a data set $D(t)=\\{e_1,...,e_t\\}$ are stored. Q-learning updates are applied on samples (or minibatches) of experience ($s,a,r,s^\\prime _\\tilde{} U(D)$) during learning, which is drawn uniformly at random from the stored samples. The Q-learning updates at iteration i by using the following loss function:  \n",

    "Supervised learning is mainly used to solve regression and classification problems. It explores the relation among labeled, the target variable, and other input variables and produces a model to predict further category identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison, unsupervised learning obtains unlabeled observations and searches the hidden structure behind the input data. Both of these methods are not suitable for the desired behavior optimization problem in a dynamic process. Unlike supervised and unsupervised learning, which will not consider the capacity or some constrained environments, reinforcement learning will start with a clear initial setting, goal, and interactive agent. All the sequential action the agent takes will generate some influence in this environment. After a dynamic model training process, the agent obtains more and more rewards as desired by taking optimal actions in order to maximize the cumulative reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning models heavily lean on the concept of a Markov Decision Process, which is used to formulate a given problem and thus find an optimal solution. Generally, when we can map our problems into an MDP, we can expect that reinforcement learning can be a useful tool to solve such problems. In the next section, we will explain the details behind Markov Decision Processes and how they are constructed, and give more details about Deep Reinforcement Learning to Bid, which is the main focus in our project.\n",

    "To address the problem of budget constrained bidding in real-time advertisement, Wu et al. (2018) proposed a framework that is built on top of DQN - Deep Reinforcement Learning to Bid (DRLB). The advantage of this framework for RTB is given by the fact that it is a model-free RL approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, Wu et al. proposed training a **DQN agent** that sequentially regulates the bidding parameter $\\lambda$ (remember, the bid in DRLB takes the form of $b_i = v_i/{\\lambda}$) instead of directly producing bids, which is the case in model-based approaches like the one introduced by Cai et al. (2017). Furthermore, instead of using the immediate reward from the environment to determine an optimal policy, an additional deep neural network (called **RewardNet**) is trained simultaneously with the DQN to predict the reward. Wu et al. (2018) found that simply using the immediate reward will make the agent obsessed with taking actions to aggressively decrease $\\lambda$ from the get ho to gain more immediate reward at each step and thus effectively neglect the budget constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally an **adaptive $\\epsilon$-greedy policy**, that adjusts the exploration probability based on how the state-action value is distributed, was designed for DRLB. Hence the agent chooses action (adjusting the $\\lambda$ parameter):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ a^* = argmax_a Q(s,a) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with probability $1 -\\epsilon$ or otherwise takes a random action. $\\epsilon$ is usually initialized with a large value and then gradually annealed to a small value over time. This balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off during training, by encouraging the agent to take more random actions at the beginning of the training process (and thus explore a variety of actions), and rely on the learned DQN parameters (exploit them) further down the training process. \n",

    "This section gives a brief insight into the data structure and depicts the results of some explanatory data analysis (EDA) to provide a better understanding of the data.    \n",

    "The datasets are provided by the Demand-Side Platform (DSP) iPinYou Information Technologies Co., Ltd which is an established leading provider for audience-based programmatic adverting technology and builds RTB technology and algorithms. We examine the dataset of the advertiser with the advertiser ID \"1458\" that operates in the Chinese vertical e-commerce industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data sets are split into train and test sets according to Zhang et al. (2014), using their [Github repository](https://github.com/wnzhang/make-ipinyou-data), which is considered a benchmark format of the iPinYou dataset and also used for training and evaluating the DRLB framework. For the train set, the first seven days are used for training, while for the test dataset the last three days are used for evaluation. Hence, in total, the datasets comprise tracked performance from ten continuous days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both data sets generally record the auction price (i.e. paying and bidding price), user feedback (i.e click, conversion, impression) and ad features (e.g. ad slot ID, width, height, visibility, floor price). In this dataset, we deal with the **second price auction**, which means that the variable *payprice*, representing the highest bid of \"opponents\" bidding simultaneously on given ad placement, determines how much, in the end, will be paid for the bid request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect is that we slightly modified each dataset by including additional variables, in accordance with Wu et al (2018). We added the predicted click-through-rate (pCTR) and time intervals for every quarter of an hour in minutes (min). The pCTR is used as an indicator of the impression value (i.e. how much is a given ad placement worth - the higher the probability of the click, the more it is worth to the advertiser), which is a second parameter ($v_i$) used to calculate the bid amount for given ad placement, as explained in the introduction. Each 15 min interval represents a time step in the DRLB framework.\n",

    "As for the variable pCTR, we applied logistic regression to predict the CTR based on the features of the train set and clicks as our target variable.  \n",

User tags are processed to extract the tag list of each user. According to Zhang et al. (2014), the weekday and hour features are extracted from the timestamps. As mentioned earlier, we additionally extracted time intervals for every quarter points of an hour in minutes. Furthermore, region, city, ad slot width, height, visibility, format, ad exchange are processed in the logistic regression model as dummy variables and the ad slot floor price as numeric. In total, we have 312 binary features for the logistic regression model.   \n",

Every $C$ updates the `qnetwork_local` is cloned to obtain `qnetwork_target`, which is used for generating the Q-learning targets $y$ for the following $C$ updates to `qnetwork_local`. This makes the algorithm more stable, since generating the targets using an older set of parameters adds a delay between the time an update to `qnetwork_local` is made and the time the update affects the targets $y$, making divergence or oscillations of the learned policy much more unlikely. The input to the `qnetwork_local` is the current state $s_t$, while the `qnetwork_target` receives state $s_{t+1}$ as input.\n",

    "Unfortunately, the performance of the DRLB is unsatisfiable to say the least. Basically the agent spends all its money on the first bid request it sees (and obviously wins it). Teh fact that we've trained the model for approx. 200.000 time steps (Wu et al. suggested at least 125.000 and ideally 250.000) tells us that the subpar results most likely stem not from the fact that the model wasn't trained long enough, but rather from some other weak part of the model.\n",

Even by taking the highest lambda produced by that algorithm (which leads to lower bids), that lambda still produces much higher bids than the market price on a given ad placement, which leads to a very high spending in the first time step.\n",

    "From the graph above it seems obvious that the starting $\\lambda_0$ is too high, since there is a very sharp drop in the remaining budget in the first 10 steps (out of 96) in both subsets of the training history. Basically because of that the model is not able to learn properly, i.e. learn to spend the budget under given constraints. We strongly believe that trying out different solutions for setting $\\lambda_0$ should be considered as a potential improvement of the DRLB. \n",

Once the agent exhausted its budget though, the DQN actions obviously cannot be evaluated properly."
